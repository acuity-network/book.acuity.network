# Parachains

## Why will Acuity utilize multiple parachains?

The goal of Acuity is to become a better content web than the World Wide Web. All public content is stored on IPFS and the IPFS ids (hashes) are stored on-chain. Depending on the application, other on-chain logic will exist also.

Because Acuity is being built with Polkadot, it can utilize Substrate's <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/polkadot-network/polkadot-the-parachain-3808040a769a">parachain</a> functionality. This means instead of there being a single Acuity blockchain, there can be many, each with specialized code for a specific use-case. All Acuity content parachains will share the basic Acuity content system (text, images, video, etc), but will extend it in different ways. Each parachain will have an app as a subdomain of acuity.social. It will be possible to communicate between parachains and to link from content on one parachain to content on another. Anyone can build a new app that integrates with an existing parachain in a new way.

It will also be possible for any new Acuity blockchain to become a parachain by bidding for a slot on the Acuity relay chain.
## Parachain Airdrop
Acuity will become federated into a relay chain and multiple parachains. The initial distribution of the Acuity relay chain and all the other parachains will be airdropped from a snapshot of <router-link to="/acu">ACU</router-link> balances. For example, if you hold 10,000 ACU you will receive 10,000 ACR, 10,000 ACF, and 10,000 ACT.

If you are familiar with the Polkadot or Kusama relay chain, you will know that they provide shared security for their respective parachains and enable message passing between parachains. Acuity Relay will be the relay chains for all the Acuity parachains (detailed below).

### Acuity DeFi <span style="color: #3cc3db; font-family: Raleway; font-size: 14px;">ACU</span>

This is the current Acuity blockchain. It will serve as the DeFi hub for the Acuity ecosystem. Initially it will run the Acuity Atomic Swap DEX. It will also have private transfers similar to <a target="_blank" href="https://tornado.cash/">Tornado Cash</a>.

### Acuity Feeds <span style="color: #3cc3db; font-family: Raleway; font-size: 14px;">ACF</span>

Many social networks are based around the concept of "feeds", e.g. Twitter, YouTube. This parachain will enable users to create multiple feeds and post content in them. Here is a video of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJs0dI0ep2w">content feed functionality</a> on the previous implementation.

### Acuity Topics <span style="color: #3cc3db; font-family: Raleway; font-size: 14px;">ACT</span>

Another popular form of social network is discussions around certain topics, e.g. Reddit. This parachain will enable user to create topics for discussion that other users can participate in.

## Where should I store my ACU to ensure I receive the airdrop?
Make sure you are holding your ACU in the [Acuity Chains App](https://chains.acuity.social/).
## Does it matter if my ACU is staked or locked during the airdrop?
No, you will be awarded ACR, ACF and ACT each in equal quantity to the total ACU held including staked and locked.
## Do I need to convert my MIX to ACU before the airdrop?
No, if you haven't claimed your ACU before the airdrop you can claim your ACR, ACU, ACF and ACT separately afterwards.
## Where will these new assets be tradable?
Initially ACR, ACF and ACT will be traded alongside ACU on the <router-link to="/atomic-swap">Acuity DEX</router-link>.
