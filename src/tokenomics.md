# Tokenomics

The first Acuity parachain is ACU. It is for account profile, structured content (like a book) and feed-based content (like X, YouTube, RSS). 

ACU is a regenesis of the original MIX content chain that was built with PoW Ethereum. All MIX accounts were converted into ACU accounts 1:1 on 1st September 2020.

MIX was funded by a [2000 day linear vesting](https://docs.mix-blockchain.org/en/latest/issuance.html) from 27th April 2017 of 55 million MIX.

ACU operates essentially the same as MIX, except instead of EVM smart contracts it is implemented as Substrate pallets and uses an index network as a decentralized backend. It is [NPoS](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/#) instead of PoW.

On 27th April 2025 there was exactly 85m ACU in circulation with 4m owned by founder Jonathan Brown.

To ensure no debasement occurs, ACU will only be traded on decentralized exchanges, starting with [Hydration](https://hydration.net/).
