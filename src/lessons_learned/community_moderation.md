# Community Moderation

When the project was originally promoted in 2016 idea was that the community would organically grow by itself, which it did. A community Discord server was created and physical presentations around were being made without any direction from the founder.

However what has now become clear is that moderation of shared community spaces is critical to grow the community in the right direction. As a sculptor removes rock to realize his imagination, moderation policies are a means by which the founder can guide the community.

Futhermore, moderation needs to be consistent. Community members are taught the rules by enforcement. There must be a shared understanding of what is acceptable and what the repurcussions are for breaking the rules.

The "offical" shared space is the [Acuity Discourse](https://discourse.acuity.network/). One of the key rules of this space is that discussion of the ACU price is not permitted.

Anyone can create an unofficial shared space with the Acuity name and whichever moderations rules they want.

The goal is that in the future Acuity will have on-chain shared spaces with autonomous moderation. There will be an on-chain moderation court.
